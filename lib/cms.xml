             <summary>
             Actions and Actionhandlers are a key concept to umbraco and a developer whom wish to apply
             businessrules whenever data is changed within umbraco, by implementing the IActionHandler
             interface it's possible to invoke methods (foreign to umbraco) - this can be used whenever
             there is a specific rule which needs to be applied to content.
            
             The Action class itself has responsibility for registering actions and actionhandlers,
             and contains methods which will be invoked whenever a change is made to ex. a document, media or member
             
             An action/actionhandler will automatically be registered, using reflection 
             which is enabling thirdparty developers to extend the core functionality of
             umbraco without changing the codebase.

            The child classes are required to implement an identifier (Guid) which is used as the objecttype identifier, for

            The packager is a component which enables sharing of both data and functionality components between different umbraco installations.
            
            The output is a .umb (a zip compressed file) which contains the exported documents/medias/macroes/documenttypes (etc.)
            in a Xml document, along with the physical files used (images/usercontrols/xsl documents etc.)
            
            Partly implemented, import of packages is done, the export is *under construction*.

            Ruben Verborgh 31/12/2007: I had to change some code, I marked my changes with "DATALAYER".
            Reason: @@IDENTITY can't be used with the new datalayer.
            I wasn't able to test the code, since I'm not aware how the code functions.

            This is needed due to a design flaw where the Umbraco membership provider is located

            An umbraco task is currently only used with the translation workflow in umbraco. But is extendable to cover other taskbased system as well.
            A task represent a simple job, it will always be assigned to a user, related to a node, and contain a comment about the task.
            The user attached to the task can complete the task, and the author of the task can reopen tasks that are not complete correct.
            
            Tasks can in umbraco be used for setting up simple workflows, and contains basic controls structures to determine if the task is completed or not.

            This Class implements the Difference Algorithm published in
            "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations" by Eugene Myers
            Algorithmica Vol. 1 No. 2, 1986, p 251.  
            
            There are many C, Java, Lisp implementations public available but they all seem to come
            from the same source (diffutils) that is under the (unfree) GNU public License
            and cannot be reused as a sourcecode for a commercial application.
            There are very old C implementations that use other (worse) algorithms.
            Microsoft also published sourcecode of a diff-tool (windiff) that uses some tree data.
            Also, a direct transfer from a C source to C# is not easy because there is a lot of pointer
            arithmetic in the typical C solutions and i need a managed solution.
            These are the reasons why I implemented the original published algorithm from the scratch and
            make it avaliable without the GNU license limitations.
            I do not need a high performance diff tool because it is used only sometimes.
            I will do some performace tweaking when needed.
            
            The algorithm itself is comparing 2 arrays of numbers so when comparing 2 text documents
            each line is converted into a (hash) number. See DiffText(). 
            
            Some chages to the original algorithm:
            The original algorithm was described using a recursive approach and comparing zero indexed arrays.
            Extracting sub-arrays and rejoining them is very performance and memory intensive so the same
            (readonly) data arrays are passed arround together with their lower and upper bounds.
            This circumstance makes the LCS and SMS functions more complicate.
            I added some code to the LCS function to get a fast response on sub-arrays that are identical,
            completely deleted or inserted.
            
            The result from a comparisation is stored in 2 arrays that flag for modified (deleted or inserted)
            lines in the 2 data arrays. These bits are then analysed to produce a array of Item objects.
            
            Further possible optimizations:
            (first rule: don't do it; second: don't do it yet)
            The arrays DataA and DataB are passed as parameters, but are never changed after the creation
            so they can be members of the class to avoid the paramter overhead.
            In SMS is a lot of boundary arithmetic in the for-D and for-k loops that can be done by increment
            and decrement of local variables.
            The DownVector and UpVector arrays are alywas created and destroyed each time the SMS gets called.
            It is possible to reuse tehm when transfering them to members of the class.
            See TODO: hints.

            Changes:
            2002.09.20 There was a "hang" in some situations.
            Now I undestand a little bit more of the SMS algorithm. 
            There have been overlapping boxes; that where analyzed partial differently.
            One return-point is enough.
            A assertion was added in CreateDiffs when in debug-mode, that counts the number of equal (no modified) lines in both arrays.
            They must be identical.
            
            2003.02.07 Out of bounds error in the Up/Down vector arrays in some situations.
            The two vetors are now accessed using different offsets that are adjusted using the start k-Line. 
            A test case is added. 
            
            2006.03.05 Some documentation and a direct Diff entry point.
            
            2006.03.08 Refactored the API to static methods on the Diff class to make usage simpler.
            2006.03.10 using the standard Debug class for self-test now.
                       compile with: csc /target:exe /out:diffTest.exe /d:DEBUG /d:TRACE /d:SELFTEST Diff.cs
            2007.01.06 license agreement changed to a BSD style license.
            2007.06.03 added the Optimize method.

            each line is converted into a (hash) number. This hash-value is computed by storing all
